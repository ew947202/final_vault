## Summary
During the dinner in [[The Tomb of Man]] [[Ma Chao]] & [[Yuan Shang]] dinner was poisoned. Who did it well that's for [[Krillium Krew]] to find out.

## Notes
- During [[The Tomb of Man]] the [[Krillium Krew]] saw [[Han Sui]] leaving the inn that was dedicated to the Zhong emissaries. [[Jurian Flintfoot]] was able to pick up a faint magical item coming from his pouch.
- During the dinner [[Althaea Moffet]] is able to detect a Green Dragon poison laced on both [[Ma Chao]] & [[Yuan Shang]] dinner. [[Krillium Krew]] is able to stop them from consuming the poisoned meal


- Later, [[Jurian Flintfoot]] & [[Ketti Barques]] go to question the servers who gave the royals the poisoned food. The server confesses to poisoning the food. They question him a little more about who gave him the poison, it seems to be a hobgoblin. The server tells them that Han Li, [[Han Sui]] cousin, paid him to kill [[Ma Chao]]. 

- [[Jurian Flintfoot]] & [[Ketti Barques]] head to the servers house looking for clues and are led to the nasty inn they visited a few days ago to get the mithril they were after. We go to the second floor of the inn and find Han Li packing his bags and planning to run away with his wife. [[Ketti Barques]], [[Kuma Kabutomushi]], [[Ma Chao]], and [[Jurian Flintfoot]] capture the couple and begin questioning them.
	- The group learns that [[Han Sui]] wanted [[Ma Chao]] dead so he could make a play for ruling the [[Campaign/Organizations/Kingdom of Liang|Kingdom of Liang]]. 
	- [[Yuan Shang]] was attempted to be murdered because he slept with Han Li's wife.


- [[Ketti Barques]] finds a note from [[Han Sui]] to his cousin *'Cousin, the time of our family playing second to the Ma's is over. I'll not suffer any further insults from them. I've invited the Zhong and I've received an emissary from Cao Cao of Wei to fund this endeavor'*

- Currently [[Althaea Moffet]] is running after [[Han Sui]] after he teleported away.
