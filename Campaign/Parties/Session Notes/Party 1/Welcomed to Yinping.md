### Session Summary

We sorted/identified all the loot [[Ketti Barques]] and [[Kuma Kabutomushi]]  were able to get from the slave caravan. We learned that [[Dong Zhuo]] killed [[Yuan Fang]] according to [[Wu Shen Jiao]] . We finished traveling to [[Yinping]] and as we docked found four Nataloid ships. The party meets with [[Yuan Shang]] and he immediately let's us in on all his problems he's been having while in [[Yinping]]. The most crucial one is that [[Ma Teng]] will not be back home until next week. We learn that [[Yuan Shang]] is supposed to be married off to [[Ma Lianli]] which is one of the twins daughters of [[Ma Teng]]. Unfortunately, [[Yuan Shang]] has been sleeping with both the daughters and got one of them pregnant.

We are invited to a dinner at [[Ma Teng]]'s palace. There were representatives from the [[Grand Duchy of Song]] and a religious cult of Xagaros called the [[Red Hands]] . The leader of this cult [[Drezzard]] spoke to Kuma during the dinner and asked him how much for [[Althaea Moffet]] and [[Wu Shen Jiao]] , presumably to eat them.

We ended the dinner by making formal introductions to the [[Ma Teng]] family and hoping to get closer to them and find out which of the twins are pregnant.

### Downtime Summary 

> [!kirk|info]+ [[Kuma Kabutomushi]]  & [[Jurian Flintfoot]]  Downtime 
Kuma and Jurian discuss how much he has been dying and why Jurian feels the need to insert himself where a wizard has no place going.


> [!kirk|info]+ [[Ketti Barques]]  & [[Jurian Flintfoot]]  Downtime 
Ketti & Jurian finally go on there date for the spell scroll Ketti got him. During the lunch date they discuss [[Yuan Tan]] Â and how Ketti doesn't trust him and thinks he doesn't value our party.  
Jurian attempts to learn more about Ketti's past, but it seems that he doesn't remember much of anything.


> [!kirk|info]+ [[Wu Shen Jiao]]  & [[Jurian Flintfoot]]  Downtime 
> >Jurian recieved three scrolls from [[Yuan Tan]]: *Comprehend Language*, *Dispel Magic*, *Counter Spell*.
> 
> [[Jurian Flintfoot]] asks [[Wu Shen Jiao]] about [[Yuan Tan]] and how she would describe him: *[[Yuan Tan]]  is an ambitious person. No being rises to power or remains thus without driving ambition, particularly in these tumultuous times. [[Yuan Tan]] can be ruthless. He send his armies against his rivals, resulting in many deaths. To not act in such a manner in this time of civil war is to wait for death to come for you are your people.*
> [[Jurian Flintfoot]] learns that [[Wu Shen Jiao]] is all-consumed by her research of the hobgoblin race and they vow to help each other reach their personal goals.
