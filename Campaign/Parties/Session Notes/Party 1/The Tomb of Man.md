### Recap of Last Session 

### Log

- [[Ma Mei]] is likely not with child... she said that is nearly impossible.
	- We go to the palace and look at the note and dagger that was stuck to [[Yuan Shang]] door regarding the pregnancy
	- [[Jurian Flintfoot]] cast's mending on the dagger and finds out it was made in [[Liang Confederation]] 
- [[Yuan Shang]] lets us know that this could be a branch line of the Ma family. Potentially the key is will the the original Ma family.
- [[Chang'an]] is the original home of the Ma family line. [[Ma Yunlei]] is apart of the Ma family that, may have information regarding the keys.

- [[Krillium Krew]] heads over to where the [[Li Ru]] & [[Hu Xiong]] to potentially try and steal one of them.

- [[Han Sui]] walks out of the Zhong ship unguarded.... SUSPICIOUS
	- [[Jurian Flintfoot]] casts *Detect Magic*
		- [[Han Sui]] walks out with some magical items from the Zhong camp....


- Duchy of Liang is a confederacy where three governors decided to unite and they elected [[Ma Teng]] as the leader. [[Han Sui]] is a govern and holds power and land along the east boarder of [[Campaign/Organizations/Kingdom of Liang|Kingdom of Liang]]. Meaning any invasion that the [[Kingdom of Zhong]] launch will hit [[Han Sui]]  land first.

- [[Li Ru]] and [[Han Sui]] seem rather familiar. The inn has a secret entrance that goes near the stone pillars the [[Red Hands]] are currently guarding. It seems to be the same tunnels that [[Ketti Barques]] & [[Jurian Flintfoot]] previously explored.
  
- [[Krillium Krew]] shows [[Han Sui]] the whale... he left whatever magical item he got from [[Li Ru]] at home


- Dinner night 4, [[Drezzard]] immediately messages [[Kuma Kabutomushi]] asking about the humans again.
	- All of the food is normal, except for the dishes that go to [[Ma Chao]] & [[Yuan Shang]]. It has green dragon poison laced in it.
		- [[Han Sui]] looks shocked and appalled... in the sense that someone is going off plan and doesn't like the fact that someone is trying to poison [[Ma Chao]].
		- [[Li Ru]] has stopped eating there food, as if their food has been poisoned.
		- [[Red Hands]] look more anticipatory once [[Althaea Moffet]] mentioned that the food was poisoned. As if they are ready to fight... 
		- Two separate servers put the correct plate in front of both [[Ma Chao]] & [[Yuan Shang]], seems as if they were told which plates had been poisoned. 
- [[Drezzard]], flagship is the Leviathan. 


- [[Drezzard]] says to everyone at dinner *We are looking for the Temple of Man. We will pay anyone with information 15,000 shards and put them under the [[Red Hands]]  protection*
	- He stops us in the courtyard... he knows about these tombs and what is inside them from Xagaros. There is a creature imprisoned in the tomb of man, one as old as Xagaros... he wants to eat it. "*10,000 years of knowledge sounds delicious*". 
		- He refers to the [[Clan Pestilens]] as 'The Lost Clan'.
		- [[Althaea Moffet]] told [[Drezzard]] that [[Clan Pestilens]] is looking for the tomb and then he left and said he would go talk to them.
