## Overview

An independent skaven clan that is located in the undercity of [[Chang'an]]. The current leader is [[Rotsqueak Bloatfurt]] and they have been attacking [[Chang'an]] and stealing food.

## Notes

- [[Krillium Krew]] arrived in [[Chang'an]] and that night were attacked by [[Clan Bigbelly]]. The crew was able to stop the invasion and captured one of the skaven. The skaven was questioned and let us know the current leader is [[Rotsqueak Bloatfurt]] and all they want is food.
